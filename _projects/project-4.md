summary: "This project investigates strategies to enhance medication adherence using customer discovery methodologies. Through a blend of qualitative and quantitative research, we examined patient behaviors, obstacles, and motivations related to medication use. Findings suggest that collaboration among multiple stakeholders is crucial, while legislation, though supportive, plays a secondary role."

objectives:
  - "Identify the main factors influencing medication adherence.
Determine the roles of stakeholders—pharmacists, physicians, and legislators—in improving adherence.
Explore the potential and limitations of regulatory solutions and ethical implications of new technologies in adherence tracking."
outcomes:
  - "Stakeholder Collaboration: Effective medication adherence enhancing interventions (MAEIs) often result from collaborative efforts between pharmacists, physicians, and patients, rather than from legislation alone.
European MAEI Reimbursement: In Europe, a limited number of MAEIs, such as multi-dose drug dispensing and medication reviews, receive reimbursement, showing that such interventions can be recognized and supported financially.
Regulatory Limitations: Current global legislation on medication adherence is underdeveloped, and uniform metrics are needed before effective regulatory measures can be implemented.
Ethical Considerations in Adherence Tech: Tracking patients to monitor adherence presents significant privacy concerns, revealing a tension between public health interests and individual autonomy.
In light of these findings, our hypothesis remains that direct healthcare provider efforts are more impactful than legislative approaches, although the ethical debate surrounding new adherence technologies remains unresolved. Future steps include further exploration of alternative solutions that emphasize multi-stakeholder collaboration and patient-centered education."
